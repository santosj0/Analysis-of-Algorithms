def find_maximum_subarray_quadratic(arr):
    """
    Brute Force method which examines each element of the array in a Î˜(n^2) runtime meaning a for-loop inside of
    another for-loop. The method starts at the first index of the array, checking to see if that number is greater than
    the place holder number. Then it adds the next index and checks to see if that temporary number is greater. It
    continues to check for the length of the array. Then it moves to the next index it was previously on and does the
    same. This method will return the subset of the array where the maximum number is produced. This algorithm was
    derived from "Introduction to Algorithms - Third Edition" and modified to work with Python.
    :param arr: An array of all real numbers.
    :return: Returns the start index of the subset, the last index of the subset, and the highest number, respectively.
