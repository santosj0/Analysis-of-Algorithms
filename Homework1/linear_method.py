def find_maximum_subarray_linear(arr):
    """
    Linear method to determing the maximum subarray in an array with an overall runtime of Î˜(n) which means a single
    for-loop. The method starts by taking the first index of the array as the maximum value. Next, it will take this
    value(a) and adds the next index's value(b) to the current value to get a new value(c). It then compares the new
    value(c) with the value in the next index(b) and determines which is greater. If the new value(c) is greater, then
    it replaces the current maximum value(a) with that new value(c). This process continues either until the loop
    finished, or if the new value(c) is less than the value of the next index(b). If the latter occurs, the maximum
    value(a) is replaced by the next index's value(b) and the process continues. This algorithm was derived from
    "Introduction to Algorithms - Third Edition" and modified to work with Python.
    :param arr: An array of all real numbers.
    :return: Returns the start index of the subset, the last index of the subset, and the highest number, respectively.
